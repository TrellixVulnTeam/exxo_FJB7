**Only Linux supported for now**

Build your Python package into a portable one-file binary and deploy
it just by copying it to target machine. The binary links to libc only
and doesn't require Python to be installed on the machine. Exxo was
created with DevOps professionals in mind, but the target audience may
become larger as project matures.

Exxo uses the excellent `PyRun`_ project and `zipapp`_ library. The
target binary is simply a pyrun binary with zipped application
concatenated at the end. This simple design was chosen in hope it
proves to be the most portable one (PyRun already works on most major
platforms). There's also an assumption that over time zipapps become
more popular and more essential packages will become zip safe.

In order for exxo to be practical, PyRun and CPython was patched in
the following ways:

* zipimport supports loading C extensions (otherwise too many pip
  libraries would be useless)

* zipimport is capable of loading code from ``__pycache__`` if Python
  3 is used

* original PyRun comes with few C modules distributed separately (with
  notable examples for multiprocessing or ctypes); exxo's PyRun on the
  other hand is a truly one file binary with all modules included (at
  the cost of portability loss, for now)

* all libraries standard Python extensions depend on (like sqlite3 or
  ncurses) are statically compiled in (again, it makes PyRun Linux
  only)

Quick start
-----------

Exxo is self-hosting. You can download it `here`_. The archive
contains just one file: exxo binary you should put somewhere in your
``PATH``.

Your package needs to have a working ``setup.py`` script. We'll use a
sample project from ``example`` directory in `exxo git
repository`_. It's a simple Flask application that prints connecting
IP address. It demonstrates using a C extension (gevent), handling
data files (Flask templates and static assets) and embedding gunicorn
- all in one portable binary.

Create a new virtualenv and activate it with::

    exxo venv /tmp/myenv
    . /tmp/myenv/bin/activate

The default Python version is 3.4. Use ``exxo venv -p 2.7`` for Python
2.7.

You can use the virtualenv in regular way. To build the target binary::

    cd example
    exxo build

You'll find the binary under ``target`` directory. Go on and copy it
to some server and see if it works.

Caveats
-------

Although exxo binary itself is statically linked, included C
extensions (if any) are not. All required shared libraries must be
installed on the target machine. For example, if you use ``lxml``, you
must install ``libxml2``. This shortcoming may be fixed in the future.

Also, exxo still links dynamically glibc for practical reasons
(nsswitch support, etc.). Although glibc uses ELF symbol versioning,
you shouldn't build your project on a machine with much newer version
of glibc than installed on destination server. Exxo release itself is
built on Ubuntu 10.04 to make sure it runs on every distro, including
Centos 6.

Because your application is run as zipapp, it must be zip safe. This
applies to all dependencies too, with Django being main offender,
unfortunately (but see ``example/myip/myip.py`` for tips how to use
Flask). The main violation against zip safety is using filesystem API
to read data files from inside your package. Don't do it::

    open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'index.html'))

Instead use `pkgutil`_ module and its ``get_data`` function::

    pkgutil.get_data('mypackage', 'index.html')

or `pkg_resources`_ module from ``setuptools`` for more sophisticated
API.

Note that your ``setup.py`` must have one (and exactly one)
``console_scripts`` entry point defined for ``exxo build`` to work
correctly.

Building exxo from sources
--------------------------

Building was tested only on Ubuntu. Python 3 is also required.

Install build dependencies with::

    apt-get install -y gcc make patch wget tar gzip bzip2 xz-utils blt-dev libbluetooth-dev libbz2-dev libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libdb4.8-dev libexpat1-dev libffi-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libreadline-dev libreadline6-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libstdc++6-4.4-dev libx11-dev libxau-dev libxcb1-dev libxdmcp-dev libxext-dev libxft-dev libxrender-dev libxss-dev linux-libc-dev tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev x11proto-core-dev x11proto-input-dev x11proto-kb-dev x11proto-render-dev x11proto-scrnsaver-dev x11proto-xext-dev xtrans-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev upx

Build PyRun binaries with::

    python3 -m exxo.bootstrap all

From this point exxo is usable as ``python3 -m exxo.exxo``. Type
``make build`` to build exxo binary under ``target`` directory.
